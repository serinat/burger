### burger

- The objective of this homework is to create a burger blogger using MySQL, Node, Express,Handlebars and a homemade ORM. While the app setup was very clear, the connection between the different packages, folders, files, etc. were a bit tedious and hard to connect at first. Nonetheless, I had the option of using Sequelize but decided to stick to the homework concerns and play with ORM. I kind of wish I had done the alternative but oh well...

- I am able to add new burgers but still having issues in the "devour' department. I will keep trying until I get it!!
